# EVE Online Miner's Hub

## Table of Content

#### Project Description

This project serves as a data visualization tool for miners in EVE online to keep track of their past mining history. The breakdown includes the type of minerals mined, and when are these minerals are mined. Currently the back-end repo is not initiated, and all server-related writeup will be documented in this repo, and ultimately migrate to its own place

#### Motivations

This project is inspired by Feonor's EveMiningFleet web application. But I realized there are some of the functionalities that was not incorporated in his project. So with some knowledges in JavaScript/React, I decided to flex my hand against this task and potentially contributing to the EVE community, beloved EVE miners

#### Design Concept

The project is designed with responsiveness in mind. The goal is to ensure use can access the page in different platform ranging from mobile to desktop. This responsive design will include visual aspect, such as graphing, making sure that the graph is as presentable in mobile as in desktop version.
The design language is trying to keep a minimalistic style with mild animations
