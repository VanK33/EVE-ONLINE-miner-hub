## Project Description

This project serves as a data visualization tool for miners in EVE Online to keep track of their past mining history. The breakdown includes the type of ores mined and when these ores were mined. The client side will be responsible for interacting with potential users, and provide visualization on the mining records

### Motivations

This project is inspired by Feonor's EveMiningFleet web application. However, I realized there are some functionalities that were not incorporated into his project. So, with some knowledge in JavaScript/TypeScript/React/MySQL, I decided to flex my hand against this task and potentially contribute to the EVE community and beloved EVE miners.

### Design Concept

The project is designed with responsiveness in mind. The goal is to ensure users can access the page on different platforms ranging from mobile to desktop. This responsive design will include visual aspects, such as graphing, making sure that the graph is as presentable on mobile as it is on the desktop version. The design language is trying to keep a minimalistic style with mild animations.

### Tech Stack

- React + Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Express
- MySQL
- Chart.js

</p>
Note: Each user will be linked to various characters, the primary character will always occupied the first slot, followed by other characters. <Br>

Click on the plus sign will send `POST` request of "alt" enum - refer to [Endpoints](#endpoints)

### WORK FLOW

Note: Two distinct `POST` requests for enum types - refer to [Endpoints](#endpoints)

### DATABASE DESIGN

Note:

`character_owner_hash` currently in character table is not attached to `user` table. This is intented to change/resolve in upcoming patches. See [Challenges](#challenges)

**Character role** [enum]: Primary, Alt <Br>
**Ore class** [enum]: Abyssal, Mercoxit, Complex, Variegated, Coherent, Simple <Br>
**Moon class** [enum]: R64, R32, R16, R8, R4 <Br>
**All type** [enum]: ore, moon, ice, gas <Br>

## NICE-TO-HAVE

- Adding GET request to pull minable objects by type individually and draw charts for individual results
  - Ore, Ice, Cloud, Moon
- Adding an overall profit per tick depending on the skills from individual characters, the mining ship configs, and type of minable objects (ore, ice, moon, gas)
- Adding alt management page card drag and drop functionality for better customize displaying.
- An additional `PUT` endpoint on server end to handle character transfer
- More ...
